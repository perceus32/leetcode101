## Useful tips -

* We can reduce time complexity to an extent keeping the same space complexity. But for further optimisisations, like for writing prod level code, we need to understand that in order to reduce TC, we need to increase 
the SC.
* For DP - there are two criteria to check -
  - whether optimal solution of the problem is the summation of optimal solutions of subproblems.
  -  AND whether the problem has overlapping subproblems.
* Moreover, to solve DP problems -
  - First write recursive equation.
  - Solve through recursion.
  - Top-bottom memoization.
  - Bottom up tabulation.
  - Fine tuning.
